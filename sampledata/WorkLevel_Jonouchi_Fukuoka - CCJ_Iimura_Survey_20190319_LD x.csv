Jonouchi superimposed scenes of struggles and uprisings on university campuses and in city streets with images of mushroom clouds and excerpts from horror films. A soundtrack combining human voices and noise-music accompanies the haunting scenes.

JO_010,Shinjuku Station ,新宿ステーション　,JONOUCHI Motoharu,城之内元晴,"On October 21, 1968, the demonstrators protested against the Vietnam War on the occasion of International Anti-War Day. In Shinjuku station, the demonstrations resulted in what is known as Shinjuku Riot, when some 2000 people clashed with police, destroyed train cars, and set fire in the station. In this film, Jonouchi superimposed footage of the uprising in Shinjuku, documenting the chaos of the scene. He projected the images onto himself while reciting Dada-style poetry. “In 1974 Jonouchi filmed his own performance/screening, and the currently surviving edition is a re-editing of this newly created film. Kanai Katsu, who was also at Nihon University College of Art, but working as an independent film artist rather than affiliated with the Film Club, recalled the performance/screening of Shinjuku Station, which took place at the same time as the screening of his own work in October 1974: ‘Jonouchi was dressed in what looked like a white safari outfit, and when he stood up, the first thing he did was forcibly screw something into the loop of his epaulet. It was a flashlight. I looked on dumbstruck as he called out to me in his usual loud, clear voice, “OK, here I come,” switched on the projector, and strode purposefully forward. The projected film was black and white footage of riot police and student protesters. It must have been October 21 in Shinjuku. Jonouchi screamed out, “Station! Station!” as he marched toward the screen, and when he reached a spot where the film was projected on his body, he began reciting poetry he had written. The flashlight stuck into his epaulet brilliantly lit up a notebook in his left hand. Meanwhile, his right hand made a repeated upward motion. What was it? The gesture, like beckoning, seemed to be casting some kind of spell.’ (Kanai Katsu, “Jonouchi Motoharu’s Technical Shinjuku Station,” “●,” Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, p. 45.)”—Go Hirasawa, ""Moment When a Singularity is Born: Essay on Jonouchi Motoharu,"" Collaborative Cataloging Japan, April 10, 2019, http://www.collabjapan.org/essay-go-hirasawa-jonouchi-motoharu-english ",,,1974,BW,,00:16:00,16mm ,
JO_011,Imperial Hotel,帝国ホテル,JONOUCHI Motoharu,城之内元晴,"""In 1967, Jonouchi captured on film the old Imperial Hotel [where Shelter Plan took place] in Imperial Hotel (1967-68), prior to the demolition, due to aging and ground subsidence, of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building. Today, Shelter Plan is widely known as a precious moving-image document of Hi Red Center in action, but when screening it each time, Jonouchi repeatedly sought to make the performance/screening an event in its own right, and he also consistently turned his attention to the venue, the Imperial Hotel.

'The Imperial Hotel was the site of an event by Hi Red Center, but I was also captivated by the hotel itself, mysteriously entranced by it in fact. I filmed it several times, including in a state of collapse. When I entered its corridors, I felt just like I was entering the pyramids or something. I thought I was entering the heart of the city itself.'

JO_022,Hi-Red Center Shelter Plan,ハイレッドセンター・シェルタープラン,JONOUCHI Motoharu,城之内元晴,"“Over two days, January 26–27, 1964, the Hi Red Center founders (Akasegawa Genpei, Nakanishi Natsuyuki, and Takamatsu Jiro) and Izumi Tatsu staged an event called Shelter Plan in the lobby and room 340 of the Imperial Hotel in Hibiya, Tokyo. Hi Red Center claimed to be acting on behalf of a fictitious organization, the Shelter Plan Conference, and sent invitations and instructions to specific acquaintances. When visitors arrived, they had their height, weight, shoulder width, face size, interior mouth volume and other measurements taken, and photographs taken from the front, sides, back, top of head, and bottom of shoes, generating data with which individual specifications were created for customized one-person shelters. No shelters were actually created, and the series of events—people receiving invitations, coming to the hotel as instructed, and participating in their own measurement—was the work itself. Hi Red Center was formed in 1963 with the mission of staging “direct actions,” and went beyond existing concepts of the work of art, repeatedly staging events and happenings not only at museums and art galleries but also on streets, rooftops, and trains. Shelter Plan was one of Hi Red Center’s most ambitious events, involving not only visual artists affiliated with Neo-Dada and Fluxus, but also musicians, designers, editors, and video artists.”—Go Hirasawa, ""Moment When a Singularity is Born: Essay on Jonouchi Motoharu,"" Collaborative Cataloging Japan, April 10, 2019, http://www.collabjapan.org/essay-go-hirasawa-jonouchi-motoharu-english
